# pty4all

Hey mate, are you:

- Tired of shitty reverse shell?
- Tired of hittinc ^C and loosing your shell?
- Tired of overcomplicated C2?
- In need of a real pty with auto completion and signals?
- In need of a minimalistic payload that spawns a shell?
- In need of easy-peasy persistancy?

Say no more, `pty4all` got you all covered!

By using its cutting edge technology (lolnope), you can now have a persistent multi reverse pty handler!
